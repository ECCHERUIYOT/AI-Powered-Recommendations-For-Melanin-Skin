## Business Overview

Our AI-powered recommendation system addresses the lack of tailored skincare solutions for individuals with melanin-rich skin. By leveraging two datasets on skin care products and products reviews by different users , our model delivers personalized skincare recommendations, achieving an accuracy of over 90% in predicting optimal products for various skin needs and on different budgets.

## Business Understanding

This project aims to develop a recommendation system using advanced AI techniques to cater specifically to Black womenâ€™s skincare needs. By integrating machine learning, content- based filtering, collaborative filtering, and sentiment analysis, the system will offer personalized skincare recommendations. Leveraging skin_tone (Author's skin tone (e.g. fair, tan, etc.) as a classification feature, we aim to distinguish and target products that align with melanin-rich skin concerns.

## Data Understanding

The dataset was collected via a Python scraper and contains:
- Product Information: Over 8,000 beauty products from the Sephora online store, including product and brand names, prices, ingredients, ratings, and various features. 
- User Reviews: Approximately 1 million reviews across over 2,000 products in the skincare category. These reviews include user appearances, skin types, and review ratings.

The key features include:
- Product Features: `product_id`, `product_name`, `brand_name`, `ingredients`, `rating`, `price_ksh`, `new`, `out_of_stock`, `highlights`. 
- Review Features: `author_id`, `rating`, `review_text`, `skin_type`, `skin_tone`, and
`helpfulness`.
